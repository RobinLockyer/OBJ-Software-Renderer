# Wavefront-.obj-File-Viewer
A project to learn C++

Reads vertex and face data from a wavefront .obj file and draws the faces as triangles. The object can be rotated about the X, Y and Z axes using the H, J and L keys respectively. The image can be scales using the \[ and \] keys, and the WASD keys move the image around the window.
